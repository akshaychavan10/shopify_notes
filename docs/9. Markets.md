### Catalogs

> Manual Page : https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/markets/new-markets/catalogs


**Catalogs (Markets API)**

- A **catalog** is a list of products and prices tailored for a specific context—like international customers, B2B buyers, or retail locations.
    
- Uses a **Publication** to control which products are visible in a market.
    
- Uses a **Price List** to adjust pricing—either by percentage (increase/decrease) or fixed variant prices.
    

---

**Key Components**

- **Catalog**: Defines the product set and pricing for a given market or context.
    
- **Publication**: Groups products to be published within a catalog.
    
- **PriceListParent**: Applies percentage-based adjustments (increase/decrease) across a catalog.
    
- **PriceListPrice**: Sets fixed price overrides for individual product variants.
    
- **Pricing Prioritization**: Fixed prices override percentage adjustments. Shopify applies the best match based on buyer context—company location, region, or sales channel.
    

---

**Use Cases**

- Sell different products or prices in **Canada vs. the U.S.** within one store.
    
- Configure separate catalogs for **B2B buyers** based on company location (Plus only).
    
- Tailor catalogs for **retail POS locations** with unique inventory/pricing.
