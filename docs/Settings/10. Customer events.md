**Customer Events**

- Events track what actions a customer takes on your store.
    
    - _Examples_: page views, add to cart, begin checkout, purchase, sign up.
        
- Useful for analyzing customer behavior and improving marketing.
    
- Helps in retargeting ads (e.g., show ads to users who added to cart but didnâ€™t buy).
    
- Shopify automatically records common customer events across the site.
