##  **What Are Shopify Apps?**

**Shopify Apps** are **add-ons** that you install to add extra features or functionality to a Shopify store — kind of like plugins for WordPress or extensions for Chrome.

They let you:

- Add marketing tools
    
- Automate inventory
    
- Improve SEO
    
- Add custom checkout features
    
- Connect shipping carriers
    
- Boost design, analytics, and more

- Apps help you customize a store beyond Shopify’s built-in capabilities._

##  **Types of Apps in Shopify**

1. **Built by Shopify**
    
    - Official apps developed by Shopify (e.g. Shopify Inbox, POS, Email).
        
    - Reliable, often free, and tightly integrated.
        
2. **Third-Party Apps**
    
    - Made by external developers or companies.
        
    - Found in the [Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/).
        
    - Some are free, others paid (monthly or one-time).
        
3. **Custom Apps**
    
    - Created just for your store or client (e.g. by a developer).
        
    - Used when unique features are needed that no public app provides.
