- Manage customer details, see customer order history, and group customers into segments.
- Add customers from third party source/app.

### Segment


**Customer Segments**

- **Dynamic groups** of customers based on shared traits or behaviors.
    
    - Examples: recent purchasers, high spenders, regional groups

**Building Segments**

- Use **query editor**: combines filters, operators, and values to define criteria.
    
    - Example query structure:
        
        ```
        FROM customers
        SHOW customer_name, orders, amount_spent
        WHERE [filters, operators, values]
        ```
        
- Choose filters like location, total spent, purchase count, tags, subscription status.
    
- Choose operators like `=`, `>`, `CONTAINS`, and values like city names or numeric thresholds.

**Types of Segments**

- **Templates**: Pre-built segments you can customize (e.g., "made first purchase in last 30 days").
    
- **From existing segments**: Duplicate & modify without starting from scratch.
    
- **Manual ShopifyQL editing**: For advanced users who prefer to write conditions directly. ([Shopify Help Center](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/customers/customer-segmentation/create-customer-segments?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Creating customer segments - Shopify Support"))
