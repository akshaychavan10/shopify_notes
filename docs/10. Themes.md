**Advanced Customization**

    - Theme architecture includes folders: layouts, templates, sections, snippets, assets, config, locales, and potentially blocks/metaobjects. ([Shopify](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Theme architecture - Shopify.dev"))
        
- Use **dynamic sources** like metafields and metaobjects to feed custom data into sections or blocks. ([Shopify Help Center](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/sections-and-blocks?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Shopify Help Center | Sections and blocks"))
    
- Always **duplicate a theme** before editing to create a backup. ([Shopify Help Center](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/customizing-themes?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Shopify Help Center | Customizing themes"))
