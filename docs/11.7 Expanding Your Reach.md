### **1. Amazon Sales Channel**

**How to Add:**

- Go to Shopify > Click "+" beside **Sales Channels** > Select **Amazon** and click "Add".
    
- Amazon will appear as another sales channel alongside your online store.
    
- Shopify handles **backend integration** after setup.
    

**Requirements:**

- Must be a **professional Amazon seller** (not an individual account).
    
- Must advertise in **USD**.

- Requires a **higher-tier Shopify plan**.
    

**Pros:**

- Access to **Amazon’s massive customer base**.
    
- Can be profitable if done right and at scale.
    

**Cons:**

- Highly **competitive**; customers often choose the **cheapest listing**.
    
- **Direct price comparison** with other sellers.
    
- **Less control** over branding and customer experience than with your own store.
    

**Strategic Insight:**

- Shopify stores help build a **unique niche** with more control over branding and pricing.
    
- **Impulse buys** and unique products may perform better on Shopify than Amazon.

### **2. Facebook Sales Channel**

**How to Add:**

- Easier process than Amazon.
    
- Adds a **"Shop" tab** directly on your Facebook business page.
    

**Requirements:**

- Must have a **Facebook business page**, not just a personal profile.
    
- Page should ideally be **active** with regular posts, likes, and engagement.
    

**Benefits:**

- Lets customers **browse and buy products without leaving Facebook**.
    
- If eligible, customers can **check out directly on Facebook**.
    
- Taps into **Facebook’s massive user base**.
    

**Considerations:**

- Good for exposure, but directing customers to your main Shopify store may allow for:
    
    - Better **upselling and cross-selling**.
        
    - More control over the shopping experience.
        

**Recommendation:**

- If you already have an active Facebook page (or plan to build one), adding this channel is a **smart, low-friction way to grow** your audience and sales.
