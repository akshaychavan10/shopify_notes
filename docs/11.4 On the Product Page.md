    - **Incentivizes purchases** by giving a discount, especially useful for recovering customers who might leave without buying.

        - On exit intent (when a user is about to leave the site).
            
        - On the first or second page visited.
            
        - When a user clicks a "get discount" button.
            
    - Choose **who** sees it:
