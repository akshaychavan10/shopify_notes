**Understanding Your Shopify Account**

	    ◦ It's where you manage everything: processing orders, gathering products, dealing with inventory, etc.
	    ◦ It's the part that customers don't see
	    
2. **The Storefront (Frontend)**
	    ◦ Shopify automatically provides the **"bare bones of a storefront,"** which is your actual "shop window".
