### 1. **FAQ Page – A Basic but Powerful Tool**

- The FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page is one of the most **important and often overlooked** customer service tools for e-commerce stores.
    
- Since online stores are open 24/7 with no staff available in real time, an FAQ page helps answer common questions and reduces customer confusion.
    
- **Creating an FAQ Page**:
    
    - You can use Shopify’s built-in **"add page" feature** to set up a simple FAQ page.
        
    - After running your store for about a month, you’ll start seeing patterns in customer questions—these can form the content for your FAQ page.
        
- **Why it’s useful**:
    
    - Customers get answers quickly without needing to contact support.
        
    - It helps your business look professional and trustworthy.
        
- **Customizing it**:
    
    - While a basic FAQ page works, you can use apps that make it more visually appealing with drag-and-drop features.
        
    - These apps let you organize questions, add design elements like separators or transitions, and control layout.
        
- **Cost**:
    
    - Many of these FAQ builder apps are **free for up to 5 questions**, then charge a small monthly fee for more (e.g., 10–20 questions).
        
- **Key takeaway**: Start with a simple FAQ page early on, and upgrade or customize it as your store grows.

### 2. **Tidio Live Chat – Real-Time Help for Visitors**

- Live chat is considered a **next-level customer service tool** that can really boost customer confidence.
    
- It helps customers feel like there’s someone real behind the screen, which makes your store feel more trustworthy.
    
- **What makes it effective**:
    
    - Unlike bots that often misunderstand questions, live chat gives real-time help from a human.
        
    - Customers tend to stick around longer and are more likely to buy when they know they can ask questions and get fast answers.
        
- **Main challenge**:
    
    - Someone from your team needs to be available to reply, which can be hard to manage when starting out.
        
- **Advanced Features with Tidio**:
    
    - Tidio Live Chat lets you **automatically trigger messages based on what visitors are doing**.
        
    - Example: If someone gets stuck at checkout or lands on a broken page, the chat can pop up with a helpful message like, “Need help with checkout?”
        
- **Setup**:
    
    - Once installed, you get access to a dashboard where you can manage conversations, set up automatic replies, and define event triggers.
        
- **When to use**:
    
    - Live chat might not be needed on day one, but it’s a great upgrade as your store and customer traffic grow.

### 3. **Call Center – High-End Support Option**

- A full call center is described as the **most advanced and expensive** customer service option available on Shopify.
    
- **Cost**:
    
    - Typically costs around **$250/month**, so it’s not for small or brand-new stores.
        
- **Why consider it**:
    
    - For larger or fast-growing businesses, it can provide excellent customer support at scale.
        
    - While pricey, it might be worth the cost if your business is at a stage where live agents and phone support are necessary.
        
- **Who it's for**:
    
    - Definitely **not recommended for beginners** or businesses that are still figuring things out.
        
    - Better suited for established businesses with steady revenue and high order volumes.
        
- **Main idea**:
    
    - It's important to know that **Shopify offers customer service solutions for every business stage**—from basic FAQ pages to live chat to full-scale call centers.
