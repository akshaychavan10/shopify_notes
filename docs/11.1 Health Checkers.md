#### 1. **Backup Your Store ‚Äì Rewind App**

- **Why use it**: To back up your store‚Äôs data **outside of Shopify**, just in case something goes wrong.
    
- **Why it matters**: Shopify does have backup systems, but things can still go wrong (accidents, glitches, etc.). Rewind acts like a **safety net**, so you don‚Äôt lose everything.

    - Saves your data (products, orders, themes, etc.) securely on Rewind‚Äôs servers.
        
    - You can restore your site with a click if something breaks.
        
- **Cost**:
    
    - Free trial (usually 7 days), then plans start around **$5/month**.
        
    - Includes daily backups for up to 10,000 products.
        
- **When to get it**:
    
    - It‚Äôs okay to **wait until you start getting sales**. In the beginning, you can rely on Shopify‚Äôs built-in backups if money‚Äôs tight.
